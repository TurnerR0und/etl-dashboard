# Python ETL + Dashboard Demo

This project is a complete, end-to-end data pipeline demonstration. It showcases a real-world workflow where data is **extracted, cleaned, served via an API, visualized on a dashboard, and automatically tested and deployed**.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **ETL Pipeline**: A Python script using `pandas` and `requests` to fetch UK House Price Index data, clean it, and load it into a SQLite database.  
- **FastAPI Backend**: A robust API built with FastAPI that serves the cleaned data from the database.  
- **Interactive Frontend**: A single-page dashboard built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js that visualizes the housing data.  
- **CI/CD Automation**: A GitHub Actions workflow that automatically tests the data pipeline on every push.  
- **Dockerized Deployment**: The entire application is containerized with Docker and is set up for automated deployment to Hugging Face Spaces.  

This repository is a portfolio piece demonstrating skills in **Python, data engineering, API development, frontend visualization, and DevOps practices**.

## 🛠 How to Run Locally

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TurnerR0und/etl-dashboard.git
cd etl-dashboard
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the data pipeline to generate the database:

```bash
python3 data_pipeline.py
```

Start the API server:

```bash
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

The server will be running at: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

Open the dashboard:  
Simply open `index.html` in your browser.

## 📌 Notes

- Designed as a **portfolio-ready project** to showcase ETL, API, and dashboard integration.  
- Built with simplicity in mind so the pipeline and deployment steps are clear.  
- Extendable: swap out SQLite for PostgreSQL, expand the frontend, or add monitoring/metrics for more advanced demos.
